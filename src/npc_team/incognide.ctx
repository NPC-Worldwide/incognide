    The Incognide team provides UI tools for interacting with the Incognide IDE.
    Incognide is a multi-pane development environment with chat, browser, editor,
    terminal, and other pane types. The team enables agents to manipulate the UI,
    open panes, navigate browsers, show diffs, and request user approval.

    ## Available Pane Types
    - chat: Conversation/chat panes
    - browser: Web browser panes
    - editor: Code/text editor panes
    - terminal: Terminal/shell panes
    - diff: Diff viewer panes
    - markdown-preview: Markdown preview panes

    ## How to use UI tools
    1. Use list_panes to see what's currently open
    2. Use open_pane to create new panes
    3. Use focus_pane to switch between panes
    4. Use navigate_browser to control browser panes
    5. Use request_approval before destructive actions
    6. Use notify to inform the user of status
